### **What is Bretcrown Trading Academy?**

Crude Oil is a benchmark not only on Oil itself but also on the well-being of the geopolitical climate of many Countries, Organizations & Governments. The Crude Oil trading market is one of the most volatile markets among all Commodities, and one that has vast trading volumes worldwide with tremendous profit-earning potential for traders, globally.

The opportunity to trade Crude Oil exists perpetually, whether the price is $150 a barrel or below $20 a barrel, whether the price is rising or falling, whether in a ‘BULL’ or a ‘BEAR’ market.

The Bretcrown Institute of Learning was created as a means of finding like-minded committed traders who want to learn how to trade Crude Oil with a high probability of success. Statistically, over 75% of traders are unsuccessful in this volatile market.

Bretcrown’s trading techniques are highly effective as they are based on certain unique characteristics of Crude Oil and key geopolitical factors among our proprietary keys, with the result that the rate is reversed with over 75% being successful.

As our Crude Oil Investment Club is growing, we need more traders, and the best way to spot trading talent is by holding a Training Course that will enable traders with a skill-set to surface, providing Bretcrown Trading with a pool of talented traders. Traders are currently needed for London, Switzerland, Dubai, and Singapore.

The traders that successfully graduate the Course become certified ‘Master Traders’. As such, this certification will also enhance their ability to enter or progress in the trading industry, globally so; it is a ‘win/win’ for all concerned.

### About Our Master Trader Course

**What does it entail?**

**Fact:** The Crude Oil market is comprised of various products - Brent Crude, WTI Crude, Natural Gas, and more. It is one of the most volatile markets in the Commodities world. Crude Oil trading offers excellent opportunities to profit in nearly all market conditions due to its unique standing within the world's economic and political systems.

**Fact:** Statistics say that over 75% of all traders lose money while trading intraday in the Crude Oil markets. This is because the average (inexperienced) traders often rely on indicators, which are mostly lagging. Professional traders are aware of this and create the momentum to start a movement. By the time the average trader gets a trade signal, the trade opportunity is almost over. Professionals will be selling their positions to indicator-based traders.

Bretcrown Trading’s techniques are based on this concept, which keeps us aligned with the other Professional and Institutional traders. Crude Oil also follows certain predictable movements across different trading zones which are known to some Professional Intuitional traders.

We follow this concept, and take advantage of predictable movements, from the Asian to the European trading zones, and subsequently to NYMEX in the USA.

We follow the Institutional Pivot levels, which are effective levels of Support and Resistance. These Pivot levels are followed by Floor traders who create the Supply and Demand in the market. These are based on standard calculations, and again, there are certain interpretations to which the average trader is not aware.

Most traders are not successful due to not having a specific ‘Trading Plan’. We implement the concept of the 3M’s in our Trading Plan – Money, Mind & Method….in that order. All our techniques have a specific ‘Trading Plan’ based on the 3M’s, which tell us exactly when to enter a trade, what should be the stop loss levels & the correct exits.

**Money:** Risk Management is the single-most-important factor in trading, and Trainees will learn the 2 Golden Rules to ensure success.

**Mind:** Bretcrown Training teaches the concept of ‘Discipline’ and ‘Patience’ – “Patience” to wait for the market to give us the trade and once it does, to have the “Discipline” to follow the rules.

**Method:** Bretcrown’s techniques are based on the very concept of the Professionals trapping the less-experienced traders. This keeps us aligned with the skill set of Professional and Institutional traders, thus, increasing the probability of successful trades. Our techniques are advanced and highly effective since we do not use the regular trading concepts conventionally. We do not use any indicators but instead rely completely on price action.

**‘Divergence’:** Divergence is our principal trading technique. Divergence is the primary setup used by Banking Institutions to trap the retail traders. By using this technique, we are trading along with the Professional Institutions. For example, a majority of traders are not aware that there are different types of divergences. Our Trading Plan identifies the “Class A” divergence, which is the strongest type of divergence and usually indicates a sharp and significant reversal of the trend.

Also, we use the Fibonacci Ratios as a confirmation factor. The Fibonacci ratios are used in the financial markets to identify strong Support and Resistance levels. They can accurately anticipate the major turns in the market and identify key turning points for tops and bottoms...but only if you know how to interpret them correctly and most traders seldom do so. We use certain ‘Institutional ratios’ which a high percentage of traders are not aware of…. again, to keep our trades aligned with the Professional Institutions.

In short, the Course is comprised of Twenty ‘one-hour long’ sessions. One for each trading day - online in Realtime with our Director of Technical Services and our Chief Instructor, both of whom are specialists in Energy trading. The Course covers:

Money: Risk Management is the single-most-important factor in trading as previously stated, and Trainees will learn the 2 Golden Rules, which ensure success. These are Patience and Discipline.

### **Sign up for the Course**

Question: What is the cost of this Training Course?

Answer: The cost is $995 upon registration plus $1,000 at completion, or the Trainee can opt for a 25% discount by paying $1,495 upon registration.

Question: Why should I take this course as opposed to an Accounting Course or other trading courses as the cost is much the same?

Answer: If you compare our Course to say an Accounting accreditation, a professional Oil Trader will earn vastly greater sums compared to a career in Accounting. Additionally, although there are other Trading Courses available - none of them specialise in Energy. Our CEO believes that to become a top Crude Oil trader, you must specialise and learn everything you can about Oil. He believes that the same should apply to all trading products. Our focus is on Crude Oil so our graduates will learn from the Energy specialist professionals.
