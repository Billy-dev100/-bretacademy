### **What is The Online Trading Academy?**

Crude Oil is a benchmark not only on Oil itself but also on the well-being of the geopolitical climate of many Countries, Organizations & Governments. The Crude Oil trading market is one of the most volatile markets among all Commodities, and one that has vast trading volumes worldwide with tremendous profit-earning potential for traders, globally.

The opportunity to trade Crude Oil exists perpetually, whether the price is $150 a barrel or below $20 a barrel, whether the price is rising or falling, whether in a ‘BULL’ or a ‘BEAR’ market.

The Online Trading Academy was created as a means of finding like-minded committed traders who want to learn how to trade Crude Oil with a high probability of success. Statistically, over 75% of traders are unsuccessful in this volatile market.

The Online Trading Academy techniques are highly effective as they are based on certain unique characteristics of Crude Oil and key geopolitical factors among our proprietary keys, with the result that the rate is reversed with over 75% being successful.

As our Investments are growing, we need more traders, and the best way to spot trading talent is by holding a Training Course that will enable traders with a skill-set to surface, providing the Online Trading International with a pool of talented traders. Traders are currently needed for London, Switzerland, Dubai, and Singapore.

The traders that successfully graduate the Course become certified ‘Master Traders’. As such, this certification will also enhance their ability to enter or progress in the trading industry, globally so; it is a ‘win/win’ for all concerned.
