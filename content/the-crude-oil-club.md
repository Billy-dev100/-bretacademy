### **All About The Crude Oil Investment Club**

**How did The Crude Oil Investment Club come into existence?**

We created this Private Club to bring like-minded people together, who either are now investing in Crude Oil or would like to start to enjoy the benefits of Membership and our higher profit growth.

**What exactly is it and how does it work?**

It is an exclusive ‘by invitation only’ Members Club of like-minded people who wish to have the benefit of Bretcrown’s expertise and winning techniques. Members will enjoy the benefits of Bretcrown’s higher than normal profit growth is achieved because the Club applies powerful computing technologies & advanced trading strategies along with our specialist proprietary keys. The Crude Oil Investment Club has developed a trading practice known as Sculpting, not scalping. Scalping is taking advantage of small price movements by opening then closing trades in seconds or at most a few minutes. Sculpting is a skill where the trade depends on price movement and could vary from seconds to hours but still termed as day-trading as trades are closed before the end of the trading day. Sculpting is much more surgical and precise and depends on proprietary procedures and the instincts of the trader. Only a small number of traders globally can perform effectively using Sculpting methodology.Taken together, this guarantees higher returns on investment.
For example, The Crude Oil Investment Club has achieved more than 20% per month profitability during the last three months – this is an annual growth rate of 250%.

We created this Private Club to bring like-minded people together, who either are now investing in Crude Oil or would like to start, to enjoy the benefits of Membership and our higher profit growth.

### **Performance Record & Trading Strategy**

**What is the present performance record of the Club?**

For the most recent three months, the profit growth has been, 34%, 21% and 25%, respectively. We, therefore, expect an annual target of 300% is realistically achievable based upon these actual figures.

**How can the Club produce such gratifying profits?**

> **Fact:** _The Crude Oil market is comprised of various products - Brent Crude, WTI Crude, Natural Gas and more. It is one of the most volatile markets in the Commodities world. Crude Oil trading offers excellent opportunities to profit in all market conditions due to its unique standing within the world's economic and political systems._

> **Fact:** _Statistics say that over 75% of all traders lose money while trading intraday in the Crude Oil markets. This is because the average (inexperienced) traders often rely on indicators, which are mostly lagging. Professional traders are aware of this and create the momentum to start a move. By the time the average trader gets a trade signal, the trade opportunity is almost over. Professionals will be selling their positions to indicator-based traders._

Bretcrown Trading’s techniques are based on this concept, which keeps us aligned with the other Professional and Institutional traders. Crude Oil also follows certain predictable movements across different trading zones which are known to some Professional Intuitional traders. We follow this concept, and take advantage of predictable movements, from the Asian to the European trading zones, and subsequently to NYMEX in the USA.

We also follow the Institutional Pivot levels, which are effective levels of Support and Resistance. These Pivot levels are eclipsed by Floor traders who create the Supply and Demand in the market. These are based on standard calculations, and again, there are certain interpretations which the average trader is not aware of.

Most traders are not successful due to not having a specific ‘Trading Plan’. We implement the concept of the **3M’s** in our Trading Plan – **Money, Mind & Method**….in that order. All our techniques have a specific ‘Trading Plan’ based on the 3M’s, which tell us exactly when to enter a trade, what should be the stop loss levels & the correct exits.

**Money:** Risk Management is the single-most-important factor in trading, and we follow the **_2 Golden Rules,_** to ensure success - ‘Discipline’ and ‘Patience’.

**Mind:** Bretcrown adheres to the concept of ‘Discipline’ and ‘Patience’ – “Patience” to wait for the market to give us the trade and once it does, to have the “Discipline” to follow the rules.

**Method:** Bretcrown’s techniques are based on the very concept of the Professionals trapping the less-experienced traders. This keeps us aligned with the skill set of Professional and Institutional traders…. thus, increasing the probability of successful trades. Our techniques are advanced and highly effective since we do not conventionally use regular trading concepts. We do not use any indicators but instead rely completely on price action.

**‘Divergence’** Divergence is our principal trading technique. Divergence is the primary setup used by Banking Institutions to trap the retail traders. By using this technique, we are trading along with the Professional Institutions. For example, a majority of traders are not aware that there are different types of divergences. Our Trading Plan identifies the **“Class A”** divergence which is the strongest type of divergence and usually indicates a sharp and significant reversal of the trend.

In addition, we use the **Fibonacci Ratios** as a confirmation factor. The Fibonacci ratios are used in the financial markets to identify strong Support and Resistance levels. They can accurately anticipate the major turns in the market and identify key turning points for tops and bottoms...**but only if you know how to interpret them correctly** and most traders seldom do so. We use certain ‘Institutional ratios’ which a high percentage of traders are not aware of…. again, to keep our trades aligned with the Professional Institutions.
